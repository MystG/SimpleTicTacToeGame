# SimpleTicTacToeGame
This is a simple text based tic tac toe game I made in Ruby for a brief game jam a while ago. I can definitely see myself making this infinitely better. Updates to come.

To play, make sure you have the 'tic_tac_toe_cn' gem installed.
In your terminal, then, simply type in: ruby ticTacToe.rb

The directions and graphics are pretty straight forward from there, but improvements to come.
